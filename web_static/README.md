# 0x01. AirBnB clone - Web static

## Description

hbnb web static is my second approach to a simple clone of the [AirBnB website](http://airbnb.com). The goal of this project is to build the front end step-by-step.

The first step is to "design" / "sketch" / "prototype" each element:

* Create simple HTML static pages
* Style guide
* Fake contents
* No Javascript
* No data loaded from anything

HTML is the structure of my page. CSS is the styling of my page.

---

## Usage

* Clone this repository to your local machine:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/felipeserna/AirBnB_clone.git
cd AirBnB/web_static
```

Open the html file you want to watch.
